          <p>You can literally see dead people in the Neptune Memorial Reef in Miami, Florida where human remains have been used to create this artificial reef.
             People's ashes were mixed with cement to create this reef. Filefish, trunkfish, sea urchins and various other kinds of marine animals have now made this reef their home.

        <div class="card-back">
          <p>Considered as one of the best diving sites in the world, the Blue Corner Wall in Palau is a sight for sore eyes.
             Multitudes of rich marine life including schools of pelagic fish, bright sea whips, rich coral reefs, flapping eagle rays, and darting reef sharks can be spotted swimming around. But be careful as the currents are quite strong here so make sure you explore the area with experienced divers.</p>

          <p>Dive into the deep waters of Cabo, Mexico and witness the unique phenomenon of sand waterfalls.
             Strong currents force coastal shelves to spill sand like waterfalls into a 120 m abyss. You can also spot octopus, reef sharks and barracudas swimming along in this abyss.

          <p>This is one of the most phenomenal wonders of the underwater world where the surrounding park goes underwater during summer.
             The ice and snow from the surrounding Hochschwab mountains in Austria melt and convert the park into a lake. Scuba divers can plunge in and explore the green foliage underneath that is also replete with benches, trees, and plants.

          <p>The underwater waterfall in Mauritius is not an actual waterfall but an optical illusion created by sediments of silt and sand.
             This optical illusion is one of the greatest attractions of this island and the underwater slope is a sight to behold. Go swimming in the warm clear waters of this relatively new island and behold one of the underwater wonders of the world.

             Lying 2.6 m deep and full of cold, oxygen-rich water, this underwater ravine is filled with marine life like the short-tailed albatross, the Northern Fur Seal, the snow crab and different types of whales.
